## Not Applicable

This section is not applicable to the Rootstock project. This is a reference project, not an evaluation of alternatives.

Per CON-002 (First Principles Design), technology choices emerge from requirements, not from evaluating existing products. Every technology component in the architecture must be traceable to a specific requirement or constraint in this specification (MT-002). No component is included because "it's what we usually use."

*This completes the Volere requirements specification for Rootstock. All sections (1–17) are documented.*
