## Not Applicable

This section is not applicable to the Rootstock project. Rootstock is an open-source reference project, not a commercial product. There is no pricing model to specify.

The platform's cost model is described in Section 1.2 (Goals of the Project): sweepstakes-based incentives keep citizen scientist engagement costs low, with per-unit data cost approaching zero as more scitizens join. This is a stakeholder engagement model, not a product pricing model.
