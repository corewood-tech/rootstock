# Contributing to Rootstock

## Governance

Rootstock is maintained under a Benevolent Dictator governance model. Corewood holds final decision-making authority over the direction, design, and acceptance of all contributions. This model may evolve as the project matures, but for now it keeps decisions fast and the vision coherent.

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an issue first.** Before writing code, open an issue describing the problem or idea. This avoids wasted effort on changes that may not align with the project's direction.
2. **Fork and branch.** Work on a feature branch in your own fork.
3. **Keep changes focused.** One concern per pull request. Small, well-scoped PRs are reviewed faster.
4. **Follow existing patterns.** Consistency matters here. Match the conventions you see in the codebase.
5. **Submit a pull request.** Reference the related issue and describe what your change does and why.

## What to Expect

- Not every contribution will be accepted. A rejection is not a judgment on quality — it may simply not fit the current direction.
- Feedback will be direct and specific. If changes are needed, you will be told what and why.
- Final decisions rest with Corewood. Discussion is welcome, but prolonged debate over settled decisions is not.
